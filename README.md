# N_Fertilisation_Effect-META-ANALYSIS-
A Meta-Analysis on the effects of nitrogen fertilisation and fungicide on yield and fungal diseases of major crops

## Summary
This project explores the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization on the incidence of fungal diseases across major cereal crops. The analysis is based on over 2000 data points extracted from global literature sources and conducted as part of my Masterâ€™s degree research using R and Excel.

## Tools Used
- R and R packages
- Excel (data entry and cleanup)

## Key Skills
- Statistical modelling (meta-analysis)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and wrangling in R & Excel
- Research synthesis, visualization, and interpretation
- Scientific communication and reporting

## Findings
- Higher nitrogen levels were associated with increased risk of foliar fungal diseases in some cereal crops, depending on regional context and crop type.
- Both N fertilization and fungicide application can significantly affect crop yield and disease outcomes.
- However, the inputs of nitrogen and fungicides must be optimized to achieve the best performance.
- Notably, the optimization must be crop- and site-specific, considering interactions and trade-offs between yield, disease suppression, and environmental impact.
